= THM Digital Classroom

== Current functionality
Create classrooms and join via BBB API. 
It is possible to configure the feedback system (or any BBB Gateway, like Greenlight or PILOS) to connect to the digital classroom instead of a BBB cluster.
Use the classrooms (default: http://localhost:8085) as BBB server address.

The command ```./gradlew build``` on Linux / MacOSX or ```.\gradlew.bat build``` on Windows will compile the Angular frontend and produce an executable .jar artifact in _build/libs/_. which can be started via ```java -jar digital-classroom-VERSION.jar```.

=== Docker Build & Deploy
A Docker image of the application may be created via ```docker-compose build``` in the root directory of this repository. The docker container may be run with ```docker-compose up```. Any environment variables specified in <<property_values>> are propagated to the Docker container.
