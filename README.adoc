= THM Digital Classroom

== Current functionality
Create conferences and join via BBB API.
It is possible to configure the feedback system (or probably any BBB Gateway, like Greenlight or PILOS) to connect to the digital classroom instead of a BBB cluster.
Use http://localhost:8085 as address.

When creating a conference from inside the "old digital classroom" in the feedback system, a new tab should open - greeting the user.

== TODOs
- Kotlin Doc
- Check on Spring security configuration for custom session tokens.

== Open Questions
- Use BBB or classroom vocabular?
- How to configure Spring Security WebFilter for specific path?
- A user is bound to a classroom instance. Should a central user service exist, or should users always be taken from within a data structure in a classroom instance.
